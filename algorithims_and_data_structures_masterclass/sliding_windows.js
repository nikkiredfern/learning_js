// Sliding Window
//
// This pattern involves creating a window whic can either be an array
// or number from one position to another.
//
// Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or
// closes (and a new window is created).
//
// Very useful foor keeping a track of a subset of data in an array/string etc.
